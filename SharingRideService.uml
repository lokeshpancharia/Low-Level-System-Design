Algorithm for Matching
Matching Algorithms:

Greedy Algorithm: Match the closest available driver to the rider based on their current locations.
Weighted Matching: Consider factors like driver rating, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and ride fare to find the optimal match.
Bipartite Graph Matching: Use algorithms like the Hungarian algorithm to match riders and drivers optimally, considering multiple factors.
Algorithm Choice:

Geospatial Indexing: Use spatial data structures like k-d trees or quadtrees to efficiently query the nearest drivers based on the riderâ€™s location.
Real-time Adjustments: Continuously update driver locations and availability to provide real-time matching.
Request Management
Ride Requests:

Request Handling: When a rider requests a ride, create a new Ride object and use the matching algorithm to find an available driver.
Real-time Updates: Use WebSockets or similar technologies to provide real-time updates to riders and drivers about ride status.
Cancellations:

Cancellation Policies: Implement policies for riders and drivers to cancel rides, including possible penalties.
Real-time Handling: Update the Ride status to "canceled" and notify both parties in real-time.
Payments:

Payment Processing: Use the Payment class to process payments securely. Integrate with payment gateways to handle transactions.
Fare Calculation: Calculate the fare based on distance, time, and dynamic pricing models. Update the Ride object with the fare details.
Post-Ride Payment: Upon ride completion, trigger the payment process and update the ride status to "completed."
By structuring the entities and their interactions in this way, we ensure a robust and scalable design for a ride-sharing service that handles real-time matching, request management, and payment processing efficiently.
